#TODO List for Squares

MH = Must Have, VNH = Very Nice to Have, NTH = Nice to Have

- *NTH*: Add team names above and to the left of the squares array (Patriots, Falcoms).
- *MH*: Require a first and last name (two neames seperated by space)
- *MH*: Replace error toastrs with modals.

- *MH* when the field is almost full (say 98 picked), and someone buys 4 squares, you can never close out the game. The number of squares available needs to be checked before you can buy.
